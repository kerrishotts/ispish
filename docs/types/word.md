# Word

![Word](../assets/word.png)

A **word** can represent a native command, a call to a function, or the name of a variable definition. A word does not necessarily map to the English definiton of "word" -- operators like `+` are also words.

> **NOTE**: Words are not case sensitive. It is convention to use UPPERCASE when writing words.
